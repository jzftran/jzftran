### Hi there üëã

I'm J√≥zef, a PhD candidate in molecular biology with a background in chemical biology and a passion for Python!

### Background üí≠

With a solid foundation in chemical biology and extensive research experience in molecular biology, I have made the decision to pivot my career towards becoming a Python developer. Currently, I am pursuing my PhD in molecular biology, where I have honed essential skills such as analytical thinking, effective communication and management, problem-solving, and meticulous attention to detail. These qualities are highly transferrable and invaluable in the world of software development.

### Projects üë∑
During my academic journey, I have actively engaged in various projects, showcasing my skills in both automation and web development for molecular biology research. Here are a couple of notable projects:

    - [jws2txt](https://pypi.org/project/jws2txt/): jws2txt is a Python package that I developed to convert JASCO binary files into human-readable text files. This tool enables researchers to easily extract and analyze spectral data obtained from JASCO spectroscopy instruments, streamlining data processing and enhancing data interpretation.

    - [InterMetalDB](https://intermetaldb.biotech.uni.wroc.pl/): I developed InterMetalDB to be a comprehensive database of intermolecularly bound metal ions in macromolecules. This project involved designing and implementing a web-based platform using the Django framework. InterMetalDB serves as a valuable resource for researchers studying metal-ion interactions and their implications in biological systems.
